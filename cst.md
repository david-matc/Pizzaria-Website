**Form Validation** works fine. Added a single warning text instead 2.

For the **menu part** I have added a script at the bottom which updates the total value of item selected.

Made a file(**item.js**) containing all the object, which could be compared with their **key** and **values**.

Did major **CSS** part at the bottom, so it doesn't get mixed up.
